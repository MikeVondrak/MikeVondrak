# About Me
I am a life-long coder, creator, and technology enthusiast. I specialize in developing unique concepts, largely for the web, that explore how to use creativity in the digital space.

I love design, UI/UX, coding, content creation and creative problem solving. I enjoy mentoring and sharing what I have learned. I can also handle any part of the web development process, from designs to databases to deployment.

Re: A naturally curious, quality-oriented, detailed and dynamic developer of ideas for the digital domain.
